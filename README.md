USER STORY
Users of Cyclegram will be able to create a user name and password
and post photos and descriptions of bicycles to the site.  Other registered 
users will be able to post comments about any photo.

The landing page for the site is a compilation of all posted photos with username
of the poster and the caption for the photo.  Each photo on the home page is a clickable
button that directs to a page with a larger photo, logged comments, and a comment
input box.

Usernames throughout the site are clickable links to a particular users page that 
displays all the photos that user has posted.  Users will be able to delete their own 
posts.
